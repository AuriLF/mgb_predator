# Predator model experiment - vocal responses
Here we analyse the vocal responses of sooty mangabeys when presented with realistic models of leopard, eagle and viper (Gaboon and Rhinoceros). 
We coded and used for analysis all vocalisations occurring during the first 30s after model detection by the focal individual.

```r
# Dataset
# select the datafile "mangabey call wide" #NEED TO UPLOAD THE FILE ONCE WITH ONLY RELEVANT COLUMNS
csvFile <- file.choose()

dm_v  = read.csv(csvFile, header=T)

# Compute the reference time when the predator was seen
dm_v$time_predator_seen <- dm_v$time_cutoff - 30

# Calibrate start and end times relative to predator exposure
dm_v$start_time_calibrated <- dm_v$start_time_s_first - dm_v$time_predator_seen
dm_v$end_time_calibrated <- dm_v$end_time_s_last - dm_v$time_predator_seen

# Create variable call.name.unique2 transforming shrill_hoo_growl and shrill_hoo as 1 and shrill as 0
dm_v$call.name.unique2 <- ifelse(dm_v$call.name.unique %in% c("shrill_hoo", "shrill_hoo_growl"), 1, 0)

# Count the number of rows (utterances) for each exp_id in the dataset
total_utt <- dm_v %>%
  group_by(exp_id) %>%
  summarise(total_utt = n())

# Merge the total_utt back into the original dataset
dm_v <- dm_v %>%
  left_join(total_utt, by = "exp_id")

## 2. Analyse vocal utterance type vs predator type and time of vocal production
We used the type of predator as random effect so we don't use one type of predator as baseline.

```r
# Run model
m_utt_time_fixed <- brm(
  formula = call.name.unique2 ~ start_time_calibrated + (1 | context_experiment) + (1 | id),
  family = bernoulli(),
  data = dm_v,
  iter = 8000, 
  warmup = 2000,  
  chains = 4,
  control = list(adapt_delta = 0.95))
```

#### Figure. Probability of producing shrill and shrill_hoo depending on the predator type     
The bars represent the credible interval at 95% and the point is the mean posterior distribution of the model.
First number bellow predator type corresponds to the number of trials, and the number below is the number of individuals.

<img src="https://github.com/AuriLF/mgb_predator/blob/main/1.%20plots/prob%20utt.jpeg?raw=true" alt="prob_utt" width="400"/>

Tendency for  leopard response to be mostly shrill_hoo and viper response to be mostly shrills, but with large uncertainty.

# Step 3: Extract the start_time_calibrated coefficient and its confidence interval

# Step 6: Apply the logistic model to calculate the log-odds for each value in time_seq
