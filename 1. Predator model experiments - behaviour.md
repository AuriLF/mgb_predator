# 1. Predator model experiment - behaviours
Here we analyse the behavioural responses (all but vocal responses) of sooty mangabeys when presented with realistic models of leopard, eagle and viper (Gaboon and Rhinoceros). 

## Data
```r
# Dataset
# select the datafile "mangabey behaviour2" #NEED TO UPLOAD THE FILE ONCE WITH ONLY RELEVANT COLUMNS
csvFile <- file.choose()

dm_b2 = read.csv(csvFile, header=T)
```

# Table (wide format) with the number of occurrences  of behaviour per condition

  summarise(occurrences = n(), .groups = "drop") %>%  
  pivot_wider(names_from = behaviour3, values_from = occurrences, values_fill = list(occurrences = 0))

# Table (long format) with the number of occurrences  of behaviour per condition and the number of individuals

```
Fleeing represented 34.8% of total behaviours and was used by the majority of individuals (16/23), making it the most frequent behaviour across all conditions. This was followed by tail raises (24.2%, N = 8 individuals) and bipedalism (13.6%, N = 8 individuals). Other behaviours, such as approaching the model (6.1%) and yawning (4.5%), were less common (see Table). Given the high frequency of fleeing, which likely serves as an escape response, and its occurrence across all conditions, we focus on analysing how it varies depending on the type of predator.
