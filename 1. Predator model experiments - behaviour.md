# Predator model experiment - behaviours
Here we analyse the behavioural responses (all but vocal responses) of sooty mangabeys when presented with realistic models of leopard, eagle and viper (Gaboon and Rhinoceros). 
We coded and used for analysis all behaviours occurring during the first 30s after model detection by the focal individual. This means we used only the initial response given by the individual detecting the predator. 

### Main findings
#### Fleeing behaviours
Leopard = elicits long flees (~8s) 100% of the time, direction is always up and in almost most cases (8/9) individual ends up more than 3m from the ground.

Viper = elicits startle behaviours, i.e., short flees (<2s), 90% of the time, either on the ground (5/9 trials) or upwards (4/9 trials) but never more than 3m from the ground. 

Eagle = elicits mixed fleeing behaviours. Individuals flee during approx. 3-4s half of the time (5/8 trials), in all possible directions (up, down/straight). 

#### Other behaviours
Approximately half of the eagle and viper responses involved bipedalism and tail raises. 
Bipedalism has already been found when encountering vipers, but I need to find potential explanations for this behaviour when facing an eagle and for tail raises across contexts.

Fleeing was observed in 85.2% of trials (N = 23), making it the most frequent behaviour across all conditions. This was followed by tail raises (40.7%, N = 11 trials) and bipedalism (33.3%, N = 8 trials). Other behaviours, such as approaching the model, moving up or down (without fleeing) and yawning, were less common (see Table). Given the high frequency of fleeing, which likely serves as an escape response, and its occurrence across all conditions, we focus on analysing how it varies depending on the type of predator.

### Table. Number of flee behaviour occurrences with direction and duration per condition with number of trials in brackets

| Condition          | Flee down | Flee straight | Flee up | Flee duration mean(SE) in s |
|--------------------|-----------|---------------|---------|-----------------------------|
| Eagle (N=5)        | 2 (2)      | 0 (0)          | 3 (3)    | 3.41 (0.93)                  |
| Leopard (N=9)      | 0 (0)      | 0 (0)          | 9 (9)    | 7.99 (1.68)                  |  
| Viper (N=9)        | 0 (0)      | 5 (5)          | 4 (4)    | 1.55 (0.24)                  |

 In 17 trials, individuals were initially positioned either on the ground or less than 50 cm from it. In the remaining 10 trials, they were positioned between 50 cm and 3 m above the ground. Since individuals on the ground do not have the possibility to flee down, combining these two directions seemed appropriate for analyses.

#### Figure. Flee duration in s recorded depending on the type of predator     
The bars represent the credible interval at 95% and the point is the mean posterior distribution of the model.

<img src="https://github.com/AuriLF/mgb_predator/blob/main/1.%20plots/flee_duration_plot.jpeg" alt="flee_d" width="400"/>

In the analysis of flee duration, the mean flee duration was shortest in the viper condition (mean posterior distribution = 1.70, 95%-CI [1.11â€“2.79]), followed by the eagle condition (mean posterior distribution = 3.61, 95%-CI [2.07â€“6.82]), and the longest duration was observed in the leopard condition (mean posterior distribution = 8.10, 95%-CI [5.68â€“12.04]).

The pairwise comparisons showed that flee duration in the leopard condition was significantly longer than in the eagle (estimate = -4.47, 95%-CI [-8.61â€“-0.61]) and viper (estimate = 6.37, 95%-CI [3.47â€“9.82]) conditions. In contrast, flee duration in the eagle condition was not significantly different from the viper condition, although there was a tendency towards a longer flee duration in the eagle condition (estimate = 1.88, 95%-CI [-0.16â€“4.73]).

We found consistent support that the probability of fleeing upwards was high in the leopard condition (mean probability and 95% CI for fleeing up = 1, 95%-CI[0.92â€“1.00]) compared to eagle and viper (pariwise post-hoc comparisons: eagle vs leopard estimate -13.27, 95%-CI [-59.54â€“-0.21]; eagle vs viper estimate 1.21, 95%-CI [-13.13â€“18.11]; leopard vs viper estimate = 14.83, 95%-CI [1.13â€“62.46]. Eagle and viper conditions did not show significant preferences for one direction (mean probability and 95% CI for fleeing up in eagle = 0.05, 95%-CI[0.00â€“1.00]; mean probability and 95% CI for fleeing up in viper = 0.18, 95%-CI[0.00â€“1.00].
