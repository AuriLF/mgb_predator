# Predator model experiment - behaviours
Here we analyse the behavioural responses (all but vocal responses) of sooty mangabeys when presented with realistic models of leopard, eagle and viper (Gaboon and Rhinoceros). 

### Main findings
#### Fleeing behaviours
Leopard = elicits long flees (~8s) 100% of the time, direction is always up and in almost most cases (8/9) individual ends up more than 3m from the ground.

Viper = elicits startle behaviours, i.e., short flees (<2s), 90% of the time, either on the ground (5/9 trials) or upwards (4/9 trials) but never more than 3m from the ground. 

Eagle = elicits mixed fleeing behaviours. Individuals flee during approx. 3-4s half of the time (5/8 trials), in all possible directions (up, down/straight). 

#### Other behaviours
Approximately half of the eagle and viper responses involved bipedalism and tail raises. 
Bipedalism has already been found when encountering vipers, but I need to find potential explanations for this behaviour when facing an eagle and for tail raises across contexts.

Fleeing represented 34.8% of total behaviours and was used by the majority of individuals (16/23), making it the most frequent behaviour across all conditions. This was followed by tail raises (24.2%, N = 8 individuals) and bipedalism (13.6%, N = 8 individuals). Other behaviours, such as approaching the model (6.1%) and yawning (4.5%), were less common (see Table). Given the high frequency of fleeing, which likely serves as an escape response, and its occurrence across all conditions, we focus on analysing how it varies depending on the type of predator.

### Table. Number of flee behaviour occurrences with direction and duration per condition with number of individuals in brackets

| Condition          | Flee down | Flee straight | Flee up | Flee duration mean(SE) in s |
|--------------------|-----------|---------------|---------|-----------------------------|
| Eagle (N=5)        | 2(2)      | 0(0)          | 3(3)    | 3.41(0.93)                  |
| Leopard (N=9)      | 0(0)      | 0(0)          | 9(9)    | 7.99(1.68)                  |  
| Viper (N=9)        | 0(0)      | 5(5)          | 4(4)    | 1.55(0.24)                  |

 In 17 trials, individuals began either on the ground or less than 50 cm from it, and in the remaining 10 trials, they were between 50 cm and 3 m above the ground. Since individuals on the ground cannot flee down, combining these two directions seemed appropriate for analyses.

#### Figure. Flee duration in s recorded depending on the type of predator     
The bars represent the credible interval at 95% and the point is the mean posterior distribution of the model.

<img src="https://github.com/AuriLF/mgb_predator/blob/main/1.%20plots/Flee%20duration.png?raw=true" alt="flee_d" width="400"/>

In the analysis of flee duration, the mean flee duration was shortest in the viper condition (mean posterior distribution = 1.72, 95%-CI [1.11–2.80]), followed by the eagle condition (mean posterior distribution = 3.59, 95%-CI [2.10–6.86]), and the longest duration was observed in the leopard condition (mean posterior distribution = 8.09, 95%-CI [5.69–12.02]).

The pairwise comparisons showed that flee duration in the leopard condition was significantly longer than in the eagle (estimate = -4.46, 95%-CI [-8.67–-0.68]) and viper (estimate = 6.36, 95%-CI [3.46–9.94]) conditions. In contrast, flee duration in the eagle condition was not significantly different from the viper condition, although there was a tendency towards a longer flee duration in the eagle condition (estimate = 1.85, 95%-CI [-0.30–4.50]).

## 3. Analyse flee direction
```r
# Subset + create variable flee_direction2 to merge direction same (straight) and down into 0 and up into 1
dm_b2_f_dir <- dm_b2 %>%
  subset(behaviour == "f") %>%
  mutate(flee_direction2 = case_when(
      flee_direction == "up" ~ 1,   # "Up" gets 1
      TRUE ~ 0))                    # Any other direction gets 0

# Run model
m_flee_dir2_hierarchical <- brm(
  flee_direction2 ~ (1 | context_experiment) + (1 | id),
  data = dm_b2_f_dir,
  family = bernoulli(),
  chains = 4, iter = 8000, warmup = 4000,
  control = list(adapt_delta = 0.99, max_treedepth = 15))
```
We treated context_experiment and id as random effects in the flee direction model because the binary outcome (fleeing up or not) showed large variability across both predator types and individuals.

#### Figure. Probability of fleeing up depending on predator type    
The bars represent the credible interval at 95% and the point is the mean posterior distribution of the model.

<img src="https://github.com/AuriLF/mgb_predator/blob/main/1.%20plots/Flee%20direction2.jpeg" alt="flee_di" width="400"/>

We found consistent support that the probability of fleeing upwards was high in the leopard condition (mean probability and 95% CI for fleeing up = 1, 95%-CI[0.71–1.00]). However, in the eagle and viper conditions, we did not find that fleeing upwards was higher than fleeing downwards or straight. For the eagle condition, the mean probability of fleeing upwards was 0.64 (95%-CI [0.05–0.98]), while the mean probability of fleeing downwards/straight was 0.36 (95%-CI [0.02–0.95]). For the viper condition, the mean probability of fleeing upwards was 0.44 (95%-CI [0.03–0.91]), and the mean probability of fleeing downwards/straight was 0.56 (95%-CI [0.09–0.97]).
