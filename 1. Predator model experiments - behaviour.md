# 1. Predator model experiment - behaviours
Here we analyse the behavioural responses (all but vocal responses) of sooty mangabeys when presented with realistic models of leopard, eagle and viper (Gaboon and Rhinoceros). 

## Data
```r
# Dataset
# select the datafile "mangabey behaviour2" #NEED TO UPLOAD THE FILE ONCE WITH ONLY RELEVANT COLUMNS
csvFile <- file.choose()

dm_b2 = read.csv(csvFile, header=T)
```

```r
# Number of individuals per condition
dm_b2 %>% 
  group_by(context_experiment) %>% 
  summarise(unique_ids = n_distinct(id))
  
# Table (wide format) with the number of occurrences  of behaviour per condition
dm_b2_summary <- dm_b2 %>% 
  filter(!is.na(behaviour3)) %>% 
  group_by(context_experiment, behaviour3) %>%
  summarise(occurrences = n(), .groups = "drop") %>%  
  pivot_wider(names_from = behaviour3, values_from = occurrences, values_fill = list(occurrences = 0))

# Table (long format) with the number of occurrences  of behaviour per condition and the number of individuals
dm_b2_summary2 <- dm_b2 %>%
  filter(!is.na(behaviour3)) %>% 
  group_by(context_experiment, behaviour3) %>%
  summarise(occurrences = n(), individuals = n_distinct(id), .groups = "drop")
