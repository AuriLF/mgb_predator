# Predator model experiment - behaviours
Here we analyse the behavioural responses (all but vocal responses) of sooty mangabeys when presented with realistic models of leopard, eagle and viper (Gaboon and Rhinoceros). 

### Data
```r
# Dataset
# select the datafile "mangabey behaviour2" #NEED TO UPLOAD THE FILE ONCE WITH ONLY RELEVANT COLUMNS
csvFile <- file.choose()

dm_b2 = read.csv(csvFile, header=T)

```
Fleeing represented 34.8% of total behaviours and was used by the majority of individuals (16/23), making it the most frequent behaviour across all conditions. This was followed by tail raises (24.2%, N = 8 individuals) and bipedalism (13.6%, N = 8 individuals). Other behaviours, such as approaching the model (6.1%) and yawning (4.5%), were less common (see Table). Given the high frequency of fleeing, which likely serves as an escape response, and its occurrence across all conditions, we focus on analysing how it varies depending on the type of predator.

### Table. Number of flee behaviour occurrences with direction and duration per condition with number of individuals in brackets
```r
| Condition          | Flee down | Flee straight | Flee up | Flee duration mean(SE) in s |
|--------------------|-----------|---------------|---------|-----------------------------|
| Eagle (N=5)        | 2(2)      | 1(1)          | 2(2)    | 3.41(0.93)                  |
| Leopard (N=9)      | 0(0)      | 0(0)          | 9(9)    | 7.99(1.68)                  |  
| Viper (N=9)        | 0(0)      | 5(5)          | 4(4)    | 1.55(0.24)                  |
```
 In 17 trials, individuals began either on the ground or less than 50 cm from it, and in the remaining 10 trials, they were between 50 cm and 3 m above the ground. Since individuals on the ground cannot flee down, combining these two directions seemed appropriate for analyses. 

## 2. Analyse flee duration

# Only keep flee behaviours
 dm_b2_f_dur <- dm_b2 %>% 
  subset(behaviour == "f")

# Run model

  formula = flee_duration ~ context_experiment + (1 | id),
  data = dm_b2_f_dur,
  family = Gamma(link = "identity"),
  chains = 4,  
  iter = 4000,
  control = list(adapt_delta = 0.99))

#### Figure. Flee duration in s recorded depending on the type of predator     
The bars represent the credible interval at 95% and the point is the mean posterior distribution of the model.

In the analysis of flee duration, we found significant differences across the three conditions. The mean flee duration the was shortest in the viper condition (mean posterior distribution = 1.72, 95%-CI [1.12–2.80]), followed by the eagle condition (mean posterior distribution = 3.57, 95%-CI [2.09–6.78]), and the longest duration was observed in the leopard condition (mean posterior distribution = 8.10, 95%-CI [5.62–12.17]). 

The pairwise comparisons showed that flee duration in leopard condition was significantly longer than in the eagle (estimate = -4.46, 95%-CI [-8.78–-0.71]) and viper (estimate = 6.34, 95%-CI [3.26–9.80]) conditions. In contrast, flee duration in the eagle condition was not significantly different from the viper condition, although there was a tendency towards a longer flee duration in the eagle condition (estimate = 1.84, 95%-CI [-0.13–4.63]). 

## 3. Analyse flee direction
```r
# Subset + create variable flee_direction2 to merge direction same (straight) and down into 0 and up into 1
dm_b2_f_dir <- dm_b2 %>%
  subset(behaviour == "f") %>%
  mutate(flee_direction2 = case_when(
      flee_direction == "up" ~ 1,   # "Up" gets 1
      TRUE ~ 0))                    # Any other direction gets 0

# Run model
m_flee_dir2_hierarchical <- brm(
  flee_direction2 ~ (1 | context_experiment) + (1 | id),
  data = dm_b2_f_dir,
  family = bernoulli(),
  chains = 4, iter = 8000, warmup = 4000,
  control = list(adapt_delta = 0.99, max_treedepth = 15))
```
We treated context_experiment and id as random effects in the flee direction model because the binary outcome (fleeing up or not) showed large variability across both predator types and individuals.
